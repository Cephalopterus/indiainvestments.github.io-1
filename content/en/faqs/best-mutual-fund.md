If you google top mutual funds, you'd find plenty of communities or online publications tossing you some names of well performing funds.

No one can predict how markets would perform in near future (short term), or over long periods of time. And when we say no one, we really mean **no one at all**.

London stock exchange is the oldest, with ~400 years of history. US markets have been around for ~120+ years. Indian markets are young, been around for only a little over 40 years.

Despite all these data, there's no prediction algorithm or deep-learning solutions; that can predict future market behavior accurately or near-accurately. Markets would surprise you from time-to-time, and new events would keep on happening in all markets, all over the world.

Mutual funds give you exposure to markets, and their ups & downs are linked to market's movements. It's mostly not up to the fund.

Lion's share of performance of a fund, is due to luck - just having right exposure to right assets at the right time. Very little is due to fund manager's skill in asset picking.

There are different mutual funds, that invest in different types of assets. Some invest in stocks, some buy debt, while some others bet on commodities like gold etc.

The mutual fund that's best for you, is the one that help you with reaching your financial goals. If you need a certain amount of money after a given number of years; then for that financial goal, the mutual fund that helps you get there comfortably in time, is the best option.

For most retail investors, the problem is not the right fund picking. Any average fund would be good enough for most people.

Real problem is not investing enough, and relying too much on returns to make up for the low investment amount. Or not staying with a decent fund long enough.

Asking for best mutual fund is no different from asking which gym is best for you. Finding the perfect gym is not that important. Just like it's more important to be disciplined, in achieving your health & fitness goals, it's also important in achieving your financial _nirvana_.
